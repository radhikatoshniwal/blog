I love rickrolling people. There's something so harmless yet so purely evil about it. The disappointment you can spread with just one decade old prank is beautiful.  
So one fine morning I decided to make a reddit bot that rickrolls anyone who dares to ask for a link in the comments. So I used one of my old reddit accounts that already had 127 karma so I don't hit the API limit with every comment.  
Streamed all the comments from r/all and replied to any comment that had the word 'link' in it.
Result? See for yourself!

However, people hate getting rickrolled as much as I love rickrolling them. I ended up with -17 karma, and 200 subreddit bans but that's ok because it's the journey that matters not the destination!
