I recently got access to the OpenAI api and got a chance to try it out and boy am I impressed!
There are four engines that may be used, namely **davinci (most capable), curie babbage and ada (fastest)**.
I used davinci with a 0.7 temperature (a setting that essentialy determines the creativity of the generated text, 0.7 will generate fairly creative reponses).
I took some of my favourite scenes from the show and let the machine complete it. Here they are!\
#### The iconic "fold in the cheese" scene 
![foldinthecheese](https://i.imgur.com/a9KYTL4.gif)\
`Moira: Next step is to fold in the cheese.\
David: What does that mean? What does "fold in the cheese" mean?\ 
Moira: You fold it in.
David: I understand that, but how? How do you fold it? Do you fold it in half, like a piece of paper, and drop it in the pot, or, what do you do?
Moira: David, I cannot show you everything.
Moira: Now I'm going to add the eggs.
David: What does "add the eggs" mean?
Moira: Eggs are added.
David: Eggs are added. So you crack them into the pot?
Moira: No, you add the eggs.
David: You add the eggs. You're not cracking them into the pot?
Moira: No, you add the eggs. David, I'm not going to play twenty questions.
Moira: Now I'm going to add the flour.
David: What does "add the flour" mean? 
Moira: David, I am getting tired of this.
Moira: And now I'm going to add the vanilla.
David: What does "add the vanilla" mean?
Moira: David, just stop it`
