I recently got access to the OpenAI api and got a chance to try it out and boy am I impressed!
There are four engines that may be used, namely **davinci (most capable), curie babbage and ada (fastest)**.
I used davinci with a 0.7 temperature (a setting that essentialy determines the creativity of the generated text, 0.7 will generate fairly creative reponses).
I took some of my favourite scenes from the show and let the machine complete it. Here they are!\
