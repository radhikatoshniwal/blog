I recently got access to the OpenAI api and got a chance to try it out and boy am I impressed!
There are four engines that may be used, namely **davinci (most capable), curie babbage and ada (fastest)**.
I used davinci with a 0.7 temperature (a setting that essentialy determines the creativity of the generated text, 0.7 will generate fairly creative reponses).
I took some of my favourite scenes from the show and let the machine complete it. Here they are!\
### The iconic "fold in the cheese" scene

***Moira: Next step is to fold in the cheese.\
David: What does that mean? What does "fold in the cheese" mean?\
Moira: You fold it in.\
David: I understand that, but how? How do you fold it? Do you fold it in half, like a piece of paper, and drop it in the pot, or, what do you do?\
Moira: David, I cannot show you everything.***
*Moira: Now I'm going to add the eggs.\
David: What does "add the eggs" mean?\
Moira: Eggs are added.\
David: Eggs are added. So you crack them into the pot?\
Moira: No, you add the eggs.\
David: You add the eggs. You're not cracking them into the pot?\
Moira: No, you add the eggs. David, I'm not going to play twenty questions.\
Moira: Now I'm going to add the flour.\
David: What does "add the flour" mean? \
Moira: David, I am getting tired of this.\
Moira: And now I'm going to add the vanilla.\
David: What does "add the vanilla" mean?\
Moira: David, just stop it*\

### A little more Alexis

*I'm a master chef, I'm a little bit jive\
I'm a little bit nasty even when I'm nice\
I'm a little bit rock 'n' roll, I'm a little bit soul\
I'm a little bit blue if you get me alone\

### Stupid dead Tamagotchi

***David: Because the last time I left you in charge of something... \
Alexis: Ugh! This is about those stupid Tamagotchi?\
David: Actually it is. \
Alexis: You left me with six of them, David. Taking care of that many is like a full-time job!\
David: I left you with six adult Tamagotchis in perfect health! And by the time I came home, they were all dead. You have to like actively murder in order for that to happen***
*Alexis: You know what? I think it was actually your fault.
David: My fault?
Alexis: Yeah, you tell me that the Tamagotchis needed to be taken care of, but you never told me how! You should've given me instructions, like a guide on how to take care of them.
But David, I don't remember you giving me any instructions.
David: I did, I told you to take care of them.
Alexis: That's not an instruction! That's like saying "breathe"!
David: No, it's not.
Alexis: Yes, it is!
David: It is not!
Alexis: Is too!
David: Is not!*

To be fair, I also got some nonsensical texts and got these after about 10 tries but hey, who doesn't mess up the first nine times. I am super excited to explore what else I could do with gpt3 and keep you posted on any more projects I decide to take up!
